"""
test_preflight.jl — the report machinery, and proof that each check can refuse.

The second half is the load-bearing one. A gate that has only ever returned
"ok" is indistinguishable from a gate that cannot fail, so every check here is
given input it MUST reject, and the rejection is asserted to carry the right
layer — a layering that cannot distinguish two causes is decoration.

`check_injective!` is the one worth this care. In the study this was ported out
of, a content-blind float rendering collapsed `h = 0.002` and `0.004` onto one
directory: 168 sweep points became 132, and because the *status marker*
collided too, the second point of each pair was reported complete without ever
running. No error anywhere.

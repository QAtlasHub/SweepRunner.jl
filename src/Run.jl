# Run — the facade that ties work_fn to Vault, Lock, Manifest, Log
#
# Evolution across todos:
#   09: minimal (sequential, no manifest, no lock)
#   10: + Manifest (early skip)
#   11: + KeyLock (multi-master)
#   12: + retry
#   13: + automatic `pmap(WorkerPool(workers()), ...)` dispatch when
#       `nprocs() > 1`, so a single master can fan out over local
#       `addprocs(n)` or a SLURM cluster allocated via
#       `SlurmClusterManager`.  No per-file change needed in user
#       compute scripts — they still call `run!(work_fn, vault, keys)`.

    RunOpts(; workers=:auto, max_attempts=3, stale_after=600.0,

Execution options for [`run!`](@ref).

# Fields

- `workers::Symbol = :auto` — dispatch mode. `:auto` fans out over the
  Distributed `WorkerPool(workers())` via `pmap` when `nprocs() > 1`, and runs
  sequentially otherwise. `:sequential` forces the sequential path even when
  worker processes are present (useful for debugging a serialization issue).
- `max_attempts::Int = 3` — per-key retry budget. Set to `1` to disable
  retry (a failed `work_fn` is logged as `:error` instead of `:gave_up`).
- `stale_after::Float64 = 600.0` — seconds before another master can reclaim a
  held lock as stale. Passed through to `DataVault.acquire_running!`.
- `heartbeat_interval::Float64 = 60.0` — how often the per-lock heartbeat task
  refreshes DataVault's `.running` file. Enforced to be `<` `stale_after`
  (otherwise a live holder's lock could be reclaimed mid-work).
- `log_level::Symbol = :info` — event-log verbosity. At `:info` (default) the
  high-churn per-key `:lock_busy` and `:key_start` events are suppressed (their
  totals still ride in the `:stage_done` summary), keeping the JSONL log
  O(computed keys) instead of O(masters × keys) under multi-master contention.
  Set `:debug` to log them (e.g. to debug lock contention).
- `stop_flag::Union{String,Nothing}` — path to a sentinel file. When
  `isfile(stop_flag)` becomes true, [`run!`](@ref) and [`run_loop!`](@ref)
  stop dispatching new keys and return early. This is the infra equivalent
  of FiniteTemperature.jl's `STOP_NOW_\$JOB_ID` mechanism, typically created
  by a SIGUSR1 signal handler in the batch script 60 s before Slurm kills
  the job.

  **Defaults to `ENV["SWEEPRUNNER_STOP_FLAG"]`**, because the batch script
  that traps the signal and the driver that passes the option are different
  files, and the only thing they can agree on without one importing the
  other is the environment. Leaving the name to the caller meant every
  driver had to remember a variable this package never mentions; a driver
  that misspells it gets no error and no graceful stop, only a killed job.
  Pass `stop_flag=nothing` explicitly to opt out.

"""
    run!(work_fn, vault, keys; opts=RunOpts(), load=nothing) -> NamedTuple

Run `work_fn(key) -> Dict` for every `key` in `keys`, persisting through
`vault`. Writes a structured JSONL event log at
`joinpath(vault.outdir, "events_<hostname>_<pid>.jsonl")` — one file per master,
so concurrent masters never contend on a single log.

`load` names the module(s) the **worker** processes need beyond the always-loaded seam
(`ParamIO`/`DataVault`/`SweepRunner`) — typically the package or module that defines `work_fn`
and the types it touches. Accepts a `Module`, `Symbol`, `String`, or a collection of them (e.g.
`load=MyModel` or `load=[MyModel, Statistics]`). Under `:distributed`/`:slurm`, `run!` `using`s
these in `Main` on every worker before fan-out, so a compute script no longer has to hand-roll the
`for w in workers(); remotecall_fetch(…, :(using …)); end` broadcast. It is a no-op on the master
(`nprocs() == 1`) and idempotent, so it is safe even when a project still broadcasts by hand.

Early skip (todo 10): on startup a stage-level Manifest is loaded. Keys
already in the manifest are skipped — when all keys are done, the second
run-through takes O(1) filesystem operations regardless of `length(keys)`.

Contract:
- `work_fn` is expected to be a pure function: given a `DataKey`, return a
  `Dict` payload to persist via `DataVault.save!`.
- Exceptions in `work_fn` are caught and logged; the corresponding key's
  `.done` file is not written, so re-runs will pick it up.
- The stage label used for logging is `Symbol(vault.run)`.
- Manifest is monotonic: saved at end-of-stage with every newly completed key.

# Parallel dispatch

If `nprocs() > 1` (i.e. `init_workers!(mode=:distributed|:slurm)` has added
worker processes), `run!` automatically fans out over the Distributed
`WorkerPool(workers())` via `pmap`.  Each worker runs the per-key
lock-acquire → `work_fn` → `DataVault.save!` → `mark_done!` pipeline
independently.  All filesystem operations (the `.running` lock, atomic JLD2 write,
JSONL event log) are already NFS-safe, so concurrent workers inside one
master are structurally consistent with multi-master operation.

If only the master is active (`nprocs() == 1`), `run!` falls back to the
sequential loop from todo 11.  This means the same compute.jl script is
valid in three modes:

1. No `init_workers!` call at all → sequential on the master.
2. `init_workers!(mode=:distributed)` with `addprocs(n)` → local pmap fan-out.
3. `init_workers!(mode=:slurm)` inside a SLURM job → cluster fan-out.

Multi-master locking (several separate julia processes writing to the
same vault) continues to work underneath either path because the lock
layer (DataVault's `.running`) uses POSIX `link()` / atomic `rename` only.

    run_loop!(work_fn, vault, keys; opts=RunOpts(),
              max_empty_rounds=3, idle_sleep=30.0, load=nothing)

Work-stealing loop that repeatedly calls [`run!`](@ref) until there is no
more work to do. This is the infra equivalent of FiniteTemperature.jl's
`_work_loop` driver.

The loop exits when:
- `max_empty_rounds` consecutive rounds produce zero new completions, or
- `opts.stop_flag` is raised (graceful shutdown).

Default parameters (`max_empty_rounds=3`, `idle_sleep=30.0`) are the
battle-tested values from FiniteTemperature.jl.

`load` is forwarded verbatim to every [`run!`](@ref) call (see its docstring) — name the work
module(s) the workers need and the loop handles the per-round broadcast.
